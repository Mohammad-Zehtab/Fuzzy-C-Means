# Fuzzy C-Means
this code implements the Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm to group data points into clusters based on similarity. It iteratively updates cluster centroids and the degree of membership of each data point to each cluster until convergence. The code provides the final cluster assignments and cluster centers as its output.
